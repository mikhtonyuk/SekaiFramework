/** When you want to add some behavior to someone else's object

 *  AdapterFactories. The principle is similar to IAdaplable except that
 *  responsibility of adapter creation is now take the factory. Multiple adapter
 *  factories form an adapter registry where you can register your factory and
 *  query for adapters afterwards. One factory constructs adapters only for one source interface
